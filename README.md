# pwsapi

I made this wrapper for pentest.ws API to easily interact with it. Their API just seems to crash a lot and I don't think they are actively doing work on the application anyway. This may or may not work. /shrug

More or less a fun project to learn some go. I think it worked (for learning that is).

Feel free to add stuff to this if you want. I stopped once I realized stuff wasn't working.
